        <h5>Buttermilk Pancake</h5>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A very light and <em>fluffy</em> pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
        <p>As convenient as a <em>store-bought</em> mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Leaveners</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
